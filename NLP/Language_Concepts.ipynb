    "**Smilodon and Thylacosmilus:** Examples of **Parallel/Convergent Evolution** where similar structures evolved independently in species due to similar environmental pressures.\n",

    "- Environment: Water\n",
    "- Feature: **Interdigital Webbing** seen in ducks, swans, frogs, and penguins for efficient swimming.\n",

    "- Sentence 1: \"The cat is sleeping on the **sofa**.\"\n",
    "- Sentence 2: \"The cat is sleeping on the **couch**.\"\n",
    "  **Sofa** and **Couch** convey similar meanings due to their shared context.\n",
