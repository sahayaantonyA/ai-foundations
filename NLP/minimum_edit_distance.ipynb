    "## Introduction to Minimum Edit Distance\n",

    "## Sentence Segmentation: Delimiters and Punctuation\n",
    "When processing text, we need to break it into sentences. This is done using delimitersâ€”special characters that indicate sentence boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Unambiguous Delimiters**\n",
    "Some punctuation marks clearly indicate the end of a sentence:\n",
    "- **Exclamation mark (!)**\n",
    "- **Question mark (?)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:**\n",
    "- \"Where are you going?\" (Ends with '?', so it's a sentence)\n",
    "- \"That's amazing!\" (Ends with '!', so it's a sentence)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ambiguous Delimiters**\n",
    "The period ('.') is sometimes tricky because it can be part of abbreviations, names, or numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of ambiguity:**\n",
    "- \"Dr. Smith is here.\" ('Dr.' is an abbreviation, not the end of a sentence)\n",
    "- \"The U.S.A. is a country.\" (Periods appear within the name)\n",
    "\n",
    "A system must distinguish between real sentence boundaries and abbreviations.\n",
