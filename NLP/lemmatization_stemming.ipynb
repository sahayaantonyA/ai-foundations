    "# Introduction to Lemmatization and Stemming\n",
    "## What is Lemmatization?\n",
    "Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form, known as the **lemma**. Unlike simple stemming, lemmatization considers the **context and meaning** of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **go, went, gone** → **go**\n",
    "- **is, am, are, was, were** → **be**\n",
    "- **running, runs, ran** → **run**\n"
